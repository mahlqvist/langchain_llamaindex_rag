# Domain-specific RAG

This is a hands-on repo for learning and experimenting with the core features of **LlamaIndex** ðŸ¦™.

This is not a production project, more like a sandbox.

This repo contains small, focused scripts to help me understand how to use LlamaIndex.

Examples:

* `scripts/document_loader.py` â€“  Load documents from a PDF file and split into nodes.
* `scripts/vector_store.py` â€“ Store and search documents in a vector database.
* `scripts/llama_rag.py` â€“ Retrieve and generate responses.
* `scripts/gradio_llama_rag.py` â€“ Simple gradio web UI RAG demo.
